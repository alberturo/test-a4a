# Test A4A Bookstore Ecommerce


:star: [Requirement of test](https://groovy-dahlia-91d.notion.site/Frontend-Engineer-9af0a177379e4ff8a7a74d3a84dc4ac9)

This is a sample application that demonstrates an E-commerce website using the React. The application loads products a MongoDB database and displays them. Users can select to display products in a single category. Users can click on any product to get more information including pricing, image, ISBN and description. Users can select items and add them to their shopping cart

## Import Data
I have included a data file in this repo. Inside that file you will find exportation of 3 conts: ```bash export const sliderItems | export const categories | export const popularProducts ``` These 3 conts contain the data in order to mock the img, id, title and bg of the products.

## Live Demonstration

The E-commerce demo can be [viewed online here](#).

Here are screenshots that show the E-commerce demo application in use.
